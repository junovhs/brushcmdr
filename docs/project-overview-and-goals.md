# **Project Overview & Goals: Brush Commander**

## **1. Project Vision**

To create the indispensable companion app for Procreate artists, transforming brush management from a chore into a seamless, creative part of the artistic workflow. Brush Commander will serve as both a powerful personal library utility and a premium, high-value delivery portal for commercial brush assets.

## **2. The Core Problem We Solve**

Serious Procreate artists collect hundreds, if not thousands, of brushes from various creators. This leads to a disorganized, chaotic brush panel within Procreate, causing significant friction and wasted time. Artists spend more time searching for the right tool than using it. Furthermore, the delivery of large digital brush bundles is often a clunky, overwhelming experience for the customer.

Brush Commander solves this by providing a dedicated space to **import, see, organize, tag, and curate** an entire brush collection, while also offering a superior experience for accessing commercial brush packs.

## **3. Key Pillars & Guiding Principles**

These are the non-negotiable principles that guide our development.

*   **User Data is Sacred:** The user's library is their own. All data is stored locally on the user's device. The application will never upload, track, or share a user's brush library. Features must be designed to protect user data integrity above all else.
*   **A Seamless, Elegant Workflow:** The app must feel like an extension of the creative process, not a technical hurdle. Every interaction should be intuitive, fast, and visually clean. We eliminate clicks and confusion.
*   **A High-Value Commercial Portal:** When used as a delivery mechanism for Tiptop Brushes, the experience must feel premium, secure, and significantly more valuable than a simple folder of `.zip` files.
*   **Evolve Responsibly:** We must protect our existing users during any evolution of the app. New features and deployment changes will always include a clear, safe migration path for our early adopters.

## **4. High-Level Business Goals**

1.  **Establish Brush Commander as the de-facto brush manager for the Procreate community.**
2.  **Create a new, high-value revenue stream** by rebranding the "Mega Bundle" into the **"Tiptop Brush Vault,"** using Brush Commander as the premium delivery platform.
3.  **Build a loyal user base** by providing both a powerful free utility and an unparalleled commercial product experience, setting the stage for future features and products.
