This document provides a highly detailed overview of the core features implemented in Brush Commander V1.0. These features address critical artist pain points, enhance workflow efficiency, and establish Brush Commander as the indispensable tool for managing Procreate brush libraries.

## **1. The Brush Inspector: Unlocking Hidden Brush DNA & Behavior**

**Purpose:** To transform brush selection from a tedious guessing game into a swift, informed decision. Artists can deeply understand and compare their brushes without leaving Brush Commander.

**Detailed Functionality:**

*   **Effortless Access:**
    *   Accessed via a prominent "Inspect" (üîç) icon on each brush card. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   Supports keyboard navigation (`Arrow Left`/`Arrow Right`) for rapid browsing between brushes within the Inspector. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **Immersive Full-Screen Preview:**
    *   Launches a sleek, dark-themed overlay that fills the screen, focusing attention entirely on the brush. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   Displays the brush's primary `Thumbnail.png` (stroke preview) at full, pixel-perfect 1:1 resolution. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   The background features a refined dark checkerboard pattern, providing optimal contrast for brush visuals. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **Intuitive Zoom & Pan (Touch & Mouse):**
    *   **Pinch-to-Zoom (iPad/Touchscreens):** Provides a fluid, precise, and **centered** pinch-to-zoom experience. Zooming originates from the exact center of the finger gesture, feeling natural and intuitive. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Mouse Wheel Zoom (Desktop):** Smooth, responsive zoom in/out controlled by the mouse wheel, with intelligent anchoring. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Pan:** Users can effortlessly drag/swipe the zoomed image around to inspect details, whether with a mouse or touch gestures. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **No Page Zoom Interference:** The Inspector actively prevents accidental page-level zooming, ensuring a dedicated app-like experience. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **Brush DNA Visualization:**
    *   A dedicated "DNA" section on the right panel features three interactive, square thumbnails: **[IMPLEMENTED]**
        *   **Stroke:** The brush's primary stroke preview. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
        *   **Shape:** The raw `Shape.png` image, fundamental to the brush's form. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
        *   **Grain:** The raw `Grain.png` image, crucial for texture. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   Users can **tap any DNA thumbnail** to instantly swap it into the large main preview area for detailed examination. The active thumbnail is clearly highlighted. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Missing Asset Indication:** If a brush lacks a Shape or Grain asset, the respective thumbnail slot clearly displays an "N/A" label with a muted icon, preventing confusion. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **Accurate "Feel & Behavior" Insights:**
    *   This critical section provides precise, artist-friendly information about how the brush behaves, parsed directly from the `.brusharchive` data. No subjective interpretations. **[IMPLEMENTED - Core Logic]**
    *   **Key Properties Displayed:**
        *   **Tapering:** Indicates if the brush supports pressure-sensitive tapering. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
        *   **Stabilization:** Shows if the brush smooths strokes, and by how much (percentage). **[IMPLEMENTED]**
        *   **Pressure:** Identifies what pressure controls (Size, Opacity, or both). **[IMPLEMENTED]**
        *   **Tilt:** Indicates if the brush reacts to stylus tilt. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
        *   **Color:** Describes advanced color modes like "Wet Mix" or "Glazed." **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Visual Enhancements:** Each property will eventually be accompanied by a small, custom, intuitive icon that visually represents the behavior (e.g., a line with varying thickness for tapering, a water droplet for wet mix). This enhances scannability and understanding. **[PLANNED - UI ONLY]**
*   **Comprehensive Brush Details:**
    *   The Inspector's right-hand panel now consolidates **all brush-specific metadata**: **[IMPLEMENTED - Core Data]**
        *   Brush Name (prominently displayed). **[IMPLEMENTED]**
        *   `Made By:` (Author Name, extracted from `.brusharchive`). **[PLANNED - Requires Logic]** *(Current version does not extract Author Name, only displays in the Inspector title for now if it happens to be the same as brush name).*
        *   `From Set:` (Original brush set name, if applicable). **[PLANNED - Requires Logic]** *(Current version displays this on brush card, but not yet in Inspector details panel).*
        *   **Tags:** Displays all applied tags, allowing for quick reference. **[PLANNED - UI Update for Inspector]** *(Tags are displayed on main brush cards, but not yet in Inspector details panel).*
        *   **Notes:** Shows any user-added notes. **[PLANNED - UI Update for Inspector]** *(Notes are editable in main right panel, but not yet displayed in Inspector details panel).*
        *   **Favorite Status:** Indicates if the brush is a favorite. **[PLANNED - UI Update for Inspector]** *(Favorite status is visible on card, but not yet in Inspector details panel).*
    *   **Direct Editing:** The brush name, notes, and favorite status will be directly editable within the Inspector, making it a powerful hub for managing individual brush properties. **[PLANNED - Requires Logic]**
*   **Sticky DNA Selection:** When an artist switches the main preview to "Shape" or "Grain," this selection *persists* as they navigate to the next/previous brush in the Inspector. This allows for rapid, focused comparison of all brush shapes or all brush grains across their library. **[IMPLEMENTED]**

## **2. The Ultimate Backup & Restore System**

**Purpose:** To provide artists with an unparalleled level of data safety and portability for their entire brush library.

**Detailed Functionality:**

*   **One-Click Backup:**
    *   Located prominently in the sidebar, the "Backup Library" button initiates an immediate download. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Proprietary `.brushvault` Format:** The backup is saved as a single, consolidated `.brushvault` file (e.g., `brush-commander-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.brushvault`). This custom extension prevents accidental opening or corruption by other applications. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Streaming Export:** For even the largest libraries, the backup process utilizes advanced streaming technology, preventing browser crashes and ensuring smooth operation during export. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Comprehensive Data:** The `.brushvault` file contains *all* imported brush data, including previews, full `.brusharchive` contents, author/set info, user tags, and notes. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **Seamless Restore:**
    *   The "Restore Library" button allows users to select a `.brushvault` file. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Transactional Integrity:** The restore process is fully transactional. If any error occurs during restoration, the user's *existing* library remains untouched, preventing data loss. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Version Validation:** The system performs a pre-flight validation of the `.brushvault` file's internal schema version, ensuring compatibility and preventing import of corrupted or incompatible files. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Effortless Migration:** Ideal for transferring an entire library to a new device or recovering from accidental data deletion (e.g., clearing browser cache). **[IMPLEMENTED]**

## **3. Enhanced Export Workflow**

**Purpose:** To empower artists to create custom brush sets and streamline their workflow by re-packaging brushes exactly how they need them.

**Detailed Functionality:**

*   **Flexible Selection:**
    *   Users can select any individual brushes from the main grid. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   Alternatively, if no brushes are explicitly selected, the app intelligently exports *all brushes currently visible in the active filter view* (e.g., all brushes in "My Inking Set," or all "Favorites"). **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **"Create .brushset" Action:**
    *   A prominent button in the right-hand panel (desktop) or mobile action bar. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   Prompts the user for a custom name for their new `.brushset` file. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **Native Procreate Format:**
    *   The exported file is a standard `.brushset` file, ready for immediate import into Procreate. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **IP-Safe Packaging:**
    *   The app intelligently extracts and re-packages the necessary brush assets (thumbnail, shape, grain, brush archive) into the new `.brushset` file. This process is secure and respects the original brush data. **[IMPLEMENTED]**

## **4. Intelligent Organization & Filtering**

**Purpose:** To make finding and managing brushes faster and more intuitive, preventing "brush overload."

**Detailed Functionality:**

*   **Dynamic Sidebar Filters:**
    *   **Brush Sets:** The sidebar dynamically populates with the names of all imported `.brushset` files, allowing one-click filtering by original set. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
    *   **Tags:** All user-applied tags are listed, enabling quick filtering by keyword. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **Multi-Tag Filtering:**
    *   Users can now **select multiple tags** in the sidebar. The app will intelligently filter the brush grid to show only brushes that possess *all* selected tags (AND logic). This is a powerful new way to narrow down searches. **[PLANNED - Requires Logic]**
    *   *Example:* Select "INK" AND "TEXTURED" to find all textured ink brushes.
*   **Comprehensive Search:**
    *   The global search bar allows searching by brush name, original `.brushset` name, filename, and user-applied tags. **[IMPLEMENTED]**
*   **Sorting Options:**
    *   Brushes can be sorted by Name (A-Z, Z-A), Date Added (Newest, Oldest), and Set Name. **[IMPLEMENTED]**

## **5. Enhanced Brush Card Details**

**Purpose:** To provide more immediate, at-a-glance context for each brush directly on the main grid.

**Detailed Functionality:**

*   **"Made By:" Information:** Each brush card now prominently displays the "Made By:" author information (extracted from the `.brusharchive`), allowing users to easily identify the creator of the brush. **[PLANNED - Requires Logic]**
*   **"From Set:" Information:** For brushes imported as part of a `.brushset`, the original set name is displayed on the card, reinforcing its origin. **[PLANNED]** 
*   **Visual Behavior Badges:** When hovering or tapping a brush card, small, intuitive icons or badges (e.g., a "P" for Pressure, a texture icon for "Textured") will subtly appear, providing quick visual cues about the brush's core characteristics without opening the Inspector. **[PLANNED - Requires Logic]**
