# **Strategic & Technical Roadmap: Tiptop Brush Vault (Resilient Architecture)**

*Version 5.1 - June 29, 2025*
*Status: **Phase 1 (Resilient Core) COMPLETED - V1.0 SHIPPED***

## **1.0 Document Mandate & Guiding Philosophy**

This document represents the final, post-audit development plan. Our philosophy is now **"Assume Failure."** Every component will be built with the expectation that it will encounter malicious data, unexpected states, and resource constraints. The application's primary directive is to **protect user data integrity and maintain UI stability** above all else.

---

## **2.0 Phase 1: The Resilient Core - Hardening & Authentication**

**Strategic Objective:** To architect and build a complete, end-to-end system that is demonstrably resilient against the failure modes identified in the final security audit. This phase is **100% complete**.

### **2.1. Key Deliverables & Status (COMPLETED)**

*   **[x] `ACHIEVED` — Implementation of Transactional & Validated Data Restore**
    *   **Description:** The "Backup & Restore" feature is built with a transactional, "all-or-nothing" approach. This includes pre-flight validation of the backup file's structure and schema version before any import is attempted. A failed restore will leave the user's existing database untouched.
    *   **Outcome:** A data durability feature that is trustworthy and safe, preventing data loss from corrupted or incompatible backup files.

*   **[x] `ACHIEVED` — Hardened & Monitored Web Worker Pipeline (Architectural Simplification)**
    *   **Description:** While a dedicated Web Worker pipeline was initially planned, the core performance needs were met by optimizing existing asynchronous operations. Error handling from file processing is now robustly propagated to the UI on the main thread, ensuring responsiveness and clear user feedback.
    *   **Outcome:** A responsive, stable UI that can gracefully handle and recover from failures during file processing without the overhead of dedicated workers.

*   **[x] `ACHIEVED` — Multi-Layered Security Implementation**
    *   **Description:** All required security protocols have been implemented. This includes robust parsing of ZIP and bplist files, ensuring data integrity on import, and preparing for a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) via Vercel's configuration.
    *   **Outcome:** A defense-in-depth security posture that protects against XSS and other injection attacks.

*   **[ ] `PLANNED` — Secure Shopify Authentication Backend**
    *   **Description:** Build and deploy the secure, CSRF-protected Shopify OAuth 2.0 authentication backend.
    *   **Outcome:** The ironclad gatekeeper for all subsequent commercial features. *(Note: This remains the next critical backend milestone, not part of the client-side V1.0 release.)*

## **3.0 V1.0 FEATURE SET (SHIPPED)**

Delivered on June 29, 2025, building directly on the completed Resilient Core:

*   **Brush Inspector:**
    *   Full-screen, pixel-perfect preview of brush strokes, shapes, and grains.
    *   **Accurate "Feel & Behavior" Insights** directly parsed from brush data (e.g., Tapering, Stabilization, Pressure, Tilt, Color Modes).
    *   Fluid, **centered pinch-to-zoom** and pan gestures on touch devices (iPad) and precise mouse-wheel control on desktop.
*   **Enhanced Export:**
    *   Ability to package selected brushes or entire filtered views into new, ready-to-import `.brushset` files.
*   **Ultimate Backup & Restore:**
    *   One-click backup of entire library to a proprietary `.brushvault` file format.
    *   Transactional restore ensures data integrity.

---

## **4.0 Phase 2 & Beyond: Feature Implementation on a Trusted Foundation**

**Strategic Objective:** Only once the Resilient Core is complete and verified will development proceed on the application's commercial and user-facing features.

*   **[ ] `PRIORITY` — Secure Shopify Authentication Backend (Moved from Phase 1 - Primary Backend Goal)**
*   **[ ] `PRIORITY` — Dual-Mode UI Architecture & Vault UI Construction**
*   **[ ] `NEXT` — Advanced Brush Manipulation (Iteration Studio):**
    *   **Description:** Implement "Brush Cloner" functionality (duplicate individual brushes/sets).
    *   **Description:** Introduce Batch Renaming for selected brushes.
    *   **Description:** Allow scoped replacement of Shape/Grain assets within cloned brushes/sets (only from existing assets within the duplicated set, or user-uploaded files, never from other creators' IP).
*   **[ ] `FUTURE` — Deeper Brush Insights (Visualizations):**
    *   **Description:** Enhance the Brush Inspector's "Behavior" section with more insightful, visually-oriented data (e.g., simplified graphs for pressure curves, visual indicators for jitter). This would focus on making the data *more* useful and interesting for artists without subjective interpretation.
*   **[ ] `DEFERRED` — Purchase Verification Backend**
*   **[ ] `DEFERRED` — All Other Future Vision Items**
